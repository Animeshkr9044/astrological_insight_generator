✅ Astrological Insight Generator
📝 Problem Statement
Build a service that takes a user's birth details (name, date, time, and location of birth) and returns a personalized daily astrological insight, using a combination of zodiac logic and LLM-based language generation.
________________


🎯 Goals
* Parse and infer zodiac sign from input date/time.

* Use a simplified astrological rule base or dummy logic (e.g., daily prediction per zodiac).

* Call an LLM or pseudo-LLM to generate personalized, natural-language output (e.g., "Today, your grounded nature will help you handle unexpected work pressure.").

* Design the system in a way that makes it easy to plug in real Panchang data or LLMs later.
________________


🧱 Expectations
   * Clean, modular code using Python or Node.js.

   * REST API or CLI tool that takes input, calls internal modules, and returns JSON/text output.

   * Embedding or prompt generation logic stubbed in (e.g., with HuggingFace or OpenAI wrapper).

   * Hindi or multilingual support is a plus (can use dummy translation functions).

   * Bonus: simple caching or scoring logic to simulate personalization or ranking.
________________


🗃️ Deliverables
      * Code in a GitHub repo with README.

      * Instructions to run (e.g., python main.py or curl localhost:8000/predict?...).

      * Brief write-up on choices made (models used, data flow, assumptions).

🧠 Optional Variants
         * Add an option for Hindi output using IndicTrans2 or NLLB stub.

         * Include a basic vector store-based retrieval from a mock astrological text corpus.

         * Have user profiles (past behavior/preferences) influence the output.
